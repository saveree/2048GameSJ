Program Description:

ReverseRecurse.java:
ReverseRecurse is unrelated to the GUI project of the PSA, but it is 
practice for reversing an array using recursion (which is calling a method, or part
of the code), again and again until it does not apply to the code anymore. There are 3 
parts to this program - initArray, the first reverse, and the second reverse. initArray
essentially initializes the array that the user inputs. The first reverse changes the 
original array, while the second reverse makes a new array, and changes the new array, so it 
preserves the original one. 

Gui2048.java:
The GUI2048 file is the most important part of the PSA. It puts together the whole game of 2048, 
and makes it look exactly like the one on the website. The whole point of the GUI Interface is so 
we can design the game to look however we want. Most of the PSA is dedicated to bringing the game
to life, and designing it as we wish. There are several parts to this complicated code, but the main 
part is the start(), and KeyHandler. 


Unix/Linux Questions: 
1. mkdir fileName 

2. ls b* finds all the files that start with "b". Similarly, we could find all the files starting 
with a certain letter by typing ls letter*. *.txt finds all the files that are txt files. 
 
3. :tab all 

Java Questions:
4. Static means a method can be accessed without instantiating it, 
and that it can be written to and read from without creating
a separate object.

5. This student, instead of hardcoding the colors and writing
a separate method for each color, can change the colors in the methods 
depending on user input. She can use the Color class in the Java FX library too. She doesn't 
need to write a separate method for every color. She can also use inheritance since all of 
the shapes have quite relating characteristics. You can use an abstract super class for this.
